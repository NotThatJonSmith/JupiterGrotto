# JupiterGrotto

This is a project I did in my spare time when I was getting serious about this whole software thing.
My goal from the outset was to become a better *writer*, and to create more expressive, flexible code.

Therefore, this repo is kind of trashy. It's a first step toward viewing programming as authorship, instead of just code.
